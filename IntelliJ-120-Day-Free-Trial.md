#### Do I meed to use IntelliJ for this course?
No, all source code examples use Maven or Gradle. Any modern Java IDE supports these build tools.

#### Is it okay to use Eclipse for this course?
Yes. However, please understand the instructor has not used Eclipse in over 10 years and will not be able to 
answer IDE related questions. 

#### Can I use the Community Edition of IntelliJ?
Yes. The Community edition of IntelliJ is very good. The Ultimate Edition does have advanced features to support
Spring Framework development. These features are used in the course, and will not be available in the 
Community Edition.

#### How do I get the free 120 Day Trial to IntelliJ Ultimate?
See section 1 of the course. There is a lecture with a sign-up link to register. You can download IntelliJ Ultimate with a 
free 30 day trial right away. You will be emailed a code with instructions within 3-5 business days. (often faster)

#### I haven't received my 120 Day Trial code to IntelliJ Ultimate
If it has been more than 5 days, check your spam folder. (Almost always there!) If not found, email John Thompson. If 
messaging on Udemy please include the email you registered with.

#### The code I received is not working.
This is often one of the following:
* You are entering the code as a license in IntelliJ. It is not a license code. It is a code for JetBrains to 
issue you a 120 day license. Use this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/store/redeem/) to register with JetBrains. 
* If you get the error ```This coupon code is not applicable to the product.``` often it is because the email you are 
using has been registered with JetBrains in the past. Try using a different email account.

#### Can I Use the EAP version of IntelliJ?
Yep! The instructor typically runs on the EAP version to get all the latest features. The EAP version is usually 
very stable. Checkout the latest EAP version [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/)
